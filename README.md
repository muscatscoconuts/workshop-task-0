I want to make a spinning triangle that changes colors…
To make it spin I have to figure out which variables I have to make move, if I can’t make it spin ill just make it pulsate or wiggle
— spinning is in fact too hard, had to play around with x1 and y1 variables to make the triangle move funny
I had to make the canvas taller to see what was going on but now that I have one corner moving I can do the same to all the others - top corner will move divided by 2 and right corner will move by -2
x1 = 150
y1 = 200
x2 = 200
y2 = 150
x3 = 250
y3 = 250
 In the end I liked how the triangle would butt up against the corner and then change shape so I left it as is, plus a conditional that changed the color of the triangle - its kind of perpetual.
